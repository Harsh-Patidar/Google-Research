Core Research
A significant focus of our team is pursuing research that advances our understanding and improves our ability to solve new problems in the field of machine learning.
Below are several themes from our research last year.

AutoML
The goal of automating machine learning is to develop techniques for computers to solve new machine learning problems automatically,
without the need for human machine learning experts to intervene on every new problem. If weâ€™re ever going to have truly intelligent systems, 
this is a fundamental capability that we will need. We developed new approaches for designing neural network architectures using both 
reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms, scaled this work to state-of-the-art results on ImageNet classification and detection, 
and also showed how to learn new optimization algorithms and effective activation functions automatically. We are actively working with
our Cloud AI team to bring this technology into the hands of Google customers, as well as continuing to push the research in many directions.
